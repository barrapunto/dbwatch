- test that set solution to queue avoids double writing
- exclude certain files from list of extracted dbmapped and dbwatched files:
#       modified:   templates/default/misc/metakeywordsd.html
#       modified:   templates/default/misc/motd.html
#       modified:   templates/default/misc/recentTopics.html


Done:

# queue files to be written with a set, not a list, to avoid double writing to database
